Planned Improved Conquest Mode vehicle pack, though with its command system you can have fun with it without ICM. Currently as of writing this, it just makes explosions around you with accuracy levels changing dependong on altitude and weather conditions, and volume of fire depending on how many flak your flying over.

Plans:
- Flak Shrapnal damaging your plane alitte bit just be being close to you, planning to add this by just simulating some flying out from explosions and as they virtually "move" it attempts to add damage to its current position to any nearby vehicles
- Accurate Bullte Movement: I plan to make it so when flak fire, they predict where you will be by the time the bullet gets there "leading", and then the bullet takes a different amount of time depending on the planes distance.
- I plan to implement realistic strategys, such as:
   - Normal mode where they lead and constantly fire
   - Burst mode where they all wait for about 30-60s and then all fire at once at the target and from the perspective of the plane pilot, its a sudden burst of explosions around them
   - Barrage mode where they dont lead and just use pure volume of fire over a designated area where they predict the plane will be forced to move over, in the event of a predicted bombing run.
